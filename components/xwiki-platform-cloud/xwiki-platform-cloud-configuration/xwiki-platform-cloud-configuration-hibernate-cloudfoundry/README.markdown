Introduction
============

This module provides a way for configuring Hibernate by overriding values of Hibernate properties found in the standard `hibernate.cfg.xml`

It configures Hibernate by looking at the environment variables provided by CloudFoundry.

The configuration source used is the one of the `wiki-platform-cloud-configuration-default` that allows for property remapping.
